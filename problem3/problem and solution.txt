1. Redundant Calculation in useMemo:

- Issue: getPriority is called multiple times for the same balance within useMemo. This leads to unnecessary recalculations.
- Improvement: Cache the priority values within useMemo to avoid redundant calls to getPriority.

2. Incorrect Filter Logic:

- Issue: The filter condition if (lhsPriority > -99) { if (balance.amount <= 0) { return true; } } always returns false because lhsPriority is not defined within this scope.
- Improvement: Correct the filter logic to properly check the balance amount and blockchain priority.

3. State and Effects Dependencies:

- Issue: useMemo depends on prices which is not used within the memoization logic.
- Improvement: Remove unnecessary dependencies from useMemo.

4. Mapping and Sorting Outside of Memoization:

- Issue: Mapping sortedBalances to formattedBalances and rows outside useMemo causes these to be recalculated on every render.
- Improvement: Include the mapping logic within useMemo to ensure that it only recalculates when dependencies change.

5. Potential Performance Issues with useMemo:

- Issue: The sorting logic within useMemo can be optimized by avoiding repeated calls to getPriority.
- Improvement: Simplify the sorting logic by caching priority values
